The contact card will be used in the listing for each contact. 

Press and hold should trigger the edit interface. It will have 2 icons. 
1) A gold category icon showing which category they belong to.
2)  And an optional info icon that will show only if that contact has summary information. Clicking the infor icon will cause the summary details to show in the bottom of the contact card. 

If the card hads no photo, it will show a placeholder image and the hint instead.
