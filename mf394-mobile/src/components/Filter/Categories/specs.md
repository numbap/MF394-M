Every contact belongs to one of the following categories:

Work (Coins icon)
Friends & Family (Heart Icon)
Goals & Hobbies (Trophy Icon)
Community (Globe icon)
Miscellaneous (Star icon)

User can select one or more of the icon buttons for filtering. 
A header appears above the filter with the name of the selected categories. 
If 2 categories are selected, the header will show their names with a + in between. 
If more than 2 categories are selected, the header will say "Multiple Selected"

Pressing on a category button will cause it to become selected or deselected. 
Press-and-hold behavior: 
 - If 50% or more of the categories are selected, select all castegories
 - If less than 50% of the categories are selected, deselect all categories.

 Whenever the selected categories change, deselect all tags, and then filter the tags to only those that exist within contacts that are included in the selected categories.
