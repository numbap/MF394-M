The Party Plan allows users to upload group shots and add contacts in bulk with Name/Photo combinations. 

Step 1: Upload an image
Step 2: Face detection creates headshots for every face found. 
Step 3: User adds names to every photo they want to keep. Then a name is added, the border around that headshot changes from red to gree, indicating that it's passed validation and will be added to the contact list. 
Step 4: The user selects a category and some tags for the bulk upload, and then hits Save. Which causes the bulk upload to happen.
