The listing page should have a filtering interface where the user can browse their filtered contacts and edit individual contacts. 

There are 2 ways of listing contacts: Cards view or Thumbnails view. You can switch these views by pressing the views icon in the filtering interfae. In the screenshot, you can see this button on the right of the Add and Party icons. 

Pressing and holding a contact card will load the Edit screen for that contact. 
Pressing the Add button will load the Add screen to add a new contact. 
Pressing the Party button will load the Party screen to upload multiple contacts. 

At the botto of the listing, there will be links and a status bar. The status bar indicates what fraction of cards are visible in the current filter.
