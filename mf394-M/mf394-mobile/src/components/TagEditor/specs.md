The tag editor is an interface where new tags can be created or deleted. 

Tags can only be alphanumeric capital letters, with only spaces and hyphens allowed as special characters. 
When deleting a tag, a warning message should be displayed since it will also be deleted from every contact containing that tag. 

Press-and-hold behavior deletes the tag. 

Enter or pressing plus button ads the tag. 

Pressing Back takes the user to the previous screen.
