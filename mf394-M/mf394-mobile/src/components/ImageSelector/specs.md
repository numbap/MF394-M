Image Selector is used in the Add, Edit and Party interfaces. 

If an image appears on the selector, press-and-hold will delete it. 
When editing a contact, the contact photo will appear here. 
When empty, pressinf it will trigger an image upload and move onto the next step in the process. (usually some form of face detection)
