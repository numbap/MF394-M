This interface will list tags for the filter view. 
When one or more tags are selected, the app will only list contacts that are in the selected categories (multiple categories can be selected) AND contain the selected tags (multiple tags can be selected)

If NO tags are selected, then filter for ALL contacts within the selected categories. 

Pressing a tag will cause it to toggle between selected and deselected. 
Press-and-hold behavior: 
 - If 50% or more of the visible tags are selected, select all visible tags
 - If less than 50% of the visible tags are selected, deselect all visible tags.
