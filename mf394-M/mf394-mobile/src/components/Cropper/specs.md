This interface allows users to manually crop an uploaded image. 

There is a slider to change the size, and the user can drag the image around in the cropping window. 

Pressing cancel will bring the user back to the previous steps in their current workflow without selecting an image. 
Pressing "Crop" will crop the image and use it as the selected image in the current workflow. 

It is used in the Add and Edit flows.
